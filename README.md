# Battery Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes **Charging** and **Discharging** datasets of a battery system. The analysis focuses on critical parameters over time, including:
- **Impedance**
- **Electrolyte Resistance (Re)**
- **Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct)**

The goal is to compare battery behavior during charging and discharging phases.

## Discharging Dataset

### Impedance Over Time (Discharging)
- **Observation**:  
  Impedance decreases gradually over time, starting at a high value and stabilizing at lower values.
- **Conclusion**:  
  Impedance reduction indicates improved charge transfer efficiency as discharging progresses.

### Electrolyte Resistance (Re) Over Time (Low Current Regions - Discharging)
- **Observation**:  
  Electrolyte resistance remains nearly constant during low current conditions.
- **Conclusion**:  
  The electrolyte resistance is stable under low current regions during the discharging process.

### Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct) Over Time (High Current Regions - Discharging)
- **Observation**:  
  Rct decreases over time.
- **Conclusion**:  
  A reduction in charge transfer resistance indicates enhanced electron flow during discharging.

## Charging Dataset

### Impedance Over Time (Charging)
- **Observation**:  
  Impedance increases sharply at the beginning and stabilizes at a higher value over time.
- **Conclusion**:  
  Rising impedance is due to the buildup of charge during charging before reaching equilibrium.

### Electrolyte Resistance (Re) Over Time (Low Current Regions - Charging)
- **Observation**:  
  Electrolyte resistance remains nearly constant.
- **Conclusion**:  
  Low current regions during charging do not significantly alter electrolyte resistance.

### Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct) Over Time (High Current Regions - Charging)
- **Observation**:  
  Rct steadily increases throughout the charging phase.
- **Conclusion**:  
  Increasing charge transfer resistance reflects the growing ionic resistance as charging progresses.

## Key Insights

1. **Impedance**:  
   - During **charging**, impedance increases due to charge accumulation.  
   - During **discharging**, impedance decreases, reflecting improved charge carrier efficiency.

2. **Electrolyte Resistance (Re)**:  
   - Re remains stable under low current conditions for both charging and discharging.

3. **Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct)**:  
   - **Charging** leads to a steady increase in Rct.  
   - **Discharging** results in a gradual decrease in Rct.
